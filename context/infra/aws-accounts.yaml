version: "1.0"
last_updated: "2025-10-22"
schema_version: "1.0"

# Account ID Legend:
# * = Actual account ID extracted from code analysis
# Numbers without * = Example placeholders (replace with actual values)
#
# Known Actual Account IDs:
# - gp-nova-dev: 504015242648
# - gp-nova-test: 058264371690
# - gp-nova-prod: 975050188717

# - gp-data (databricks): 851725508471
# - gp-knowledge/CQ: "339712874290"
#
# Account Sharing Pattern:
# - Multiple bounded contexts "with"in same domain often share AWS accounts
# - Cross-domain services (like Platform Services) may have dedicated accounts
# - Not all bounded contexts need all environment types (dev/test/prod/demo)
"#"
# Usage:
# - Use this file to determine which AWS account to deploy services to
"#"- Cross-reference with code repositories to validate account IDs
# - Update account IDs as new accounts are created or discovered
